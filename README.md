# WeatherWear
 ***Project is WIP***

## About WeatherWear
Do you ever go step outside, only to realize you're unprepared for unexpected weather conditions? You'd have to go back inside to change what you're wearing, and maybe even bring an umbrella. WeatherWear is intended to help people get clothing recommendations based on weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. 

It allows you to find the weather conditions based on a location search, and this is done through an API call. 

After weather information is received, the information is parsed and the program makes a recommendation. 

## Enhancements/features to be implemented

* Ability to specify activity level, to fine tune recommendations. 

  Low activity levels(such as relaxing outside in chilly weather around a fire) may need more layers & a heavier jacket.

  High activity levels (such as jogging in chilly weather) may only need a light jacket layer or a windbreaker. 

* Ability to upload/input wardrobe, so that WeatherWear can make a recommendation based on what you have available. 

* Ability to save past results/queries

* Ability to recommend multiple locations at one time, across different days. This would be useful when traveling.
